# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe game developed in C++ with an AI opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm. The computer analyzes all possible moves and selects the optimal one, making it unbeatable. This project demonstrates recursion, backtracking, 2D arrays, and decision-making logic while strengthening problem-solving and understanding of basic AI concepts.
